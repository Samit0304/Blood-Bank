# Blood-Bank using java and mysql
The Blood Bank Management System is an integrated computer programs application designed to manage the operations of a blood bank efficiently. It addresses the challenges associated with donor management, inventory control, and blood requests. By leveraging Java for the front-end GUI and MySQL for the backend database, the system aims to streamline the management process, reduce manual errors, and ensure the availability of blood in emergency situations.
Objectives:
1. Donor Management: Implement a system to record and manage donor details, including their blood group, contact information, and donation history.
2. Inventory Management: Track the blood inventory, including the quantity of different blood groups available in the bank.
3. Request Management: Facilitate the handling of blood requests from hospitals and individuals, and monitor the status of each request.
4. Efficient Database Integration: Ensure a seamless connection between the application and the MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.
5. User-Friendly Interface: Develop a GUI using Java's JFrame to enable users to interact with the system easily.
